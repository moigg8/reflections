Question 1: 
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer 1: 
When a repository is initialized, a .git directory is created inside
repository that has been initialized. This .git repository will track 
down changes done to the files inside the directory as we create
commits.

We need to initialize a repository because this way we will be able
to create commits, and therefore, create different versions of a
directory. This will allow us to jump between versions if we make
mistakes.

Question 2:
How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer 2:
The working directory and repository represent files stored 
somewhere in your computer. The staging files are not files
that are created somewhere else in your computer inside some
staging folder. The staging area represents the files
that are going to be stored in the next commit. In other
words, the upcoming commit is going to register the changes
done only in the files that were added to the staging area.
