Question 1:
When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

Answer 1:
I would like to create a remote repository when I would like to share
my work with others. 

I would also like to create a remote repository if I want to keep my
work safe against local computer damages that might prevent me prove
getting my files back in the future. 

Finally, the last reason would be if I want to pass the project
to another computer. One way to do it would be to push the project
to GitHub and then pull it from the second extra computer.

Question 2:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer 2:
GitHub is used to share projects with other people. If my project is
not ready to be shared with other people, I would not want to upload
it to GitHub yet. If repositories were pushed automatically,
non-functional versions or test versions of my project would be
uploaded to GitHub everytime. This will mean other collaborators
would be looking at unwanted versions of the project. This might
damage the development process, and potentially damage the project
and chemistry of the team.
